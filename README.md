# PawsConnect

Open this project in the devcontainer and you should be able to run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start work. You need to install docker for this. Please download it here: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
